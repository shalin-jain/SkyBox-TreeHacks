# SkyBox

SkyBox is a compact and low-cost solution to gathering local air quality data. On a local scale, air quality can greatly differ within a community, leading to negligence of areas with low air quality.

## What it does

SkyBox uses a P2.5 Dust Sensor and an Air Quality Sensor to measure, record, and transmit accurate data of the levels of particulate matter and various gasses in the immediate air to map out the air quality of local areas. This data is mapped with GPS location and used to generate an overlay on an interactive map that one can use to analyze air quality on a local scale just by checking a website.
